1.ModuleWRapper Functions in node are exactly the same as IIFE in js:
    ::IIFE::IMMEDIATELY INVOKED FUNCTION EXPRESSIONS
    ::they have all the prerequisites like :require,module.exports defined in them
    ::so basically node have these wrapper func which are IIFE and hence we need not to call them...
    ::so anything declared inside these IIFE ModuleWRapper are protected!!
